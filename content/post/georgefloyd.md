Derek Chauvin has been found guilty on all counts for the murder of George Floyd. Without a doubt, today was an important day for justice & a step in the right direction. But so much more is left to do for sustained change and I hope this can be a turning point.

Because I love data visualization, I collected some data for this occassion to show the moment that Twitter found out about the guilty verdict:

At it's peak, ~1500 tweets were send out per second.

Here is the entire Twitter dataset I collected during the guilty verdict (ca. 2.3 million tweets in ~an hour)

If you are interested in that sort of stuff: here are the most ratio'd tweets at time of collection.
