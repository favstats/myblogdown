# About Me

<a href="docs/VottaFabio_CV.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a>

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Political Communication at the University of Amsterdam. My Ph.D. research focuses on the impact of microtargeted political advertisements on citizens and society from an empirical and computational social science perspective. I am very passionate about reproducible open science, data visualization and communicating insights from data to a broader audience.  My other research interests include the study of political and affective polarization as well as political extremism and fringe political groups online. In my spare time, I am constantly looking for new ways to improve my R skills and acquire new methods in my tool box. Finally, I am enthusiastic about teaching statistics and programming, both introductory courses or more advanced topics.
