# About Me

<a href="docs/VottaFabio_CV.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a>

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Amsterdam (Amsterdam School of Communication Research). My research focuses on digital election campaigns, specifically data-driven campaigning and political microtargeting. I am very passionate about reproducible open science, data visualization and communicating insights from data to a broader audience. In my spare time, I am constantly looking for new ways to improve my R skills and acquire new methods in my tool box. Finally, I am very enthusiastic about teaching statistics and programming, both introductory courses or more advanced topics.
