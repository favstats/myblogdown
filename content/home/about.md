# About Me

<a href="docs/VottaFabio_CV.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a>

I am currently enrolled as a master's student of *Empirical Political and Social Research* at the University of Stuttgart. My research interests include political polarization, political extremism and the interaction of religion and politics. I am also a very quantitative focused person and passionate about data and data visualization. I enjoy statistical modeling, computational social science and everything R related. At the University of Stuttgart, I tutor graduate students in statistics using both SPSS and R.
