      <description>About Me Curriculum Vitae
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Communication at the University of Amsterdam. My research focuses on the impact of microtargeted political advertisements on citizens and society. I am very passionate about reproducible open science, data visualization and communicating insights from data to a broader audience. My other research interests include the study of political extremism and fringe political groups online. In my spare time, I am constantly looking for new ways to improve my R skills and acquire new methods in my tool box.</description>
