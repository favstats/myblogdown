      <description>For anyone who is interested in exploring the Democratic primary debates of the U.S. Presidential Election, I compiled a dataset with all debates so far (i.e.: 8).
In the following blog post I will introduce the R package demdebates2020 which will be updated to include data from all Democratic debates as they are held. Further, I will present some possible use-cases and an exploratory analysis of the debates.
Start First, I load in some packages.</description>

      <title>The &#39;Greatest Deliberative Body in the World&#39;?</title>

      <description>The U.S. Senate is the &amp;ldquo;greatest deliberative body in the world&amp;rdquo;. A common phrase last used by Chief Justice John Roberts during the Impeachment Trial. But what does the data say?
I am not aware of a measure that looks at individual parliamentary bodies but V-Dem has expert ratings on the deliberative quality of political elites by country, which may serve as a proxy.
Packages First, let&amp;rsquo;s load some necessary packages.</description>

      <description>So recently I was writing functions with many if statements and pipes. Given that I am a huge fan of the %&amp;gt;% pipe workflow, I was thinking about creating a pipable if environment. Here is my attempt to implement exactly that. With a lot help from my good friend Ben. If you are reading this, thank you! You made this possible.
Import gist from here:
library(dplyr) source(&amp;quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/favstats/3e1d8b65a019b24344b7b3dea6002a0b/raw/6919b22f01db6d672d64ebcac5798b8495c89ad2/do_if.R&amp;quot;)  So let’s say you want to create a function that has multiple if specifications but you also want to always create two columns regardless of the input.</description>
