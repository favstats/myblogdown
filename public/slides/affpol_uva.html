## Introduction

&lt;!-- TODO: Write up what you want to say? --&gt;

&lt;!-- TODO: READ OPENMIND QUESTIONS --&gt;

&lt;!-- TODO: BAYESIAN MODEL READUP --&gt;

&lt;!-- TODO: Reduce Text --&gt;

&lt;!-- How good is populist vs. anti-populist as meaningful conflict line if conflict is not against populists but actually against right-wing (or extremist) views? --&gt;

## M.A. thesis topic:

Twitter ban of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones &amp; Infowars in September 2018

&lt;!-- During the post-intervention period, toxicity had an average value of approx. 0.080. By contrast, in the absence of an intervention, we would have expected an average toxicity of 0.15. The 95% interval of this counterfactual prediction is [0.13, 0.17]. Subtracting this prediction from the observed toxicity yields an estimate of the causal effect the intervention had on the response variable. This effect is -0.069 with a 95% interval of [-0.090, -0.046]. --&gt;

## Other Relevant Research

1) Alt-Right interaction with Media

2) Radical Filter Bubbles on YouTube (forthcoming)

???

Wanted to know how far-right individuals interact with each other and the media. 

Collected data on Alt-Right individuals on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter for the entire year 2017.

Found out: people who comment under Alt-Right pages mostly do so with each other only at specific events to people comment under media pages, for example for Charlottesville

Radical Filter Bubbles is a paper that studies an experimental design, bots that interact with neutral content and extreme content and see how the algorithm reacts.. I found that the algorithm produces more extreme content and ranks it higher after interaction.

## Research Outline


---

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

![](images/filter upset.png)

 
---

### Research Outline

+ Social media as ‘high choice media environments’ (Lelkes et al. 2017)

+ Online echo chambers 
  + Tendency to reduce exposure to incongruent viewpoints (Tsang 2017)
  + Algorithms that prioritize what users wants to see ("filter bubbles")
  
+ *Deinviduation* and anonimity online
  + Partisans might be more willing to produce and share negative content than in offline environments (Lee 2006)

+ Evidence suggests that exposure to supportive information increases affective polarization (Garett et al. 2014)

### Research Question

How do homogenous digital environments affect people's evaluation of ideological opponents that they have little or no contact with? 
---

class: center, middle

### Hypothesis

&gt; Individuals in online echo chambers (who interact mostly with their own ideological side) are more affectively polarized than individuals who are exposed to different political views. 

---

### Hypothesis

&gt; Individuals in online echo chambers (who interact mostly with their own ideological side) are more affectively polarized than individuals who are exposed to different political views. 


### Methodology

1. Identify and collect Twitter data on relevant political accounts for each (European) country and their followers.

2. Assign echo chamber and mixed conditions to users.

3. Assess affective polarization of users within and outside of echo chambers.

## Data Collection

---


### Political Accounts on Twitter

+ Identify (official) Twitter accounts of politicians, parties, think tanks as well as political commentators and newspapers from various European countries.

+ Goal is to meaningfully cover the entire political sphere of Twitter for each given country

+ [`legislatoR`](https://github.com/saschagobel/legislatoR) tracks publically available data for 32,533 current and former elected politicians from nine countries' legislatures including social media handles. 

+ More accounts with additional research, especially on the local and regional levels

+ Additional accounts can be webscraped from various sources

---


### Collect data with Twitter REST API

+ Collect a list of Twitter IDs for all followers of political actors 

+ Retrieve their last 3200 tweets

+ During election time for increased salience

+ Idea: Before and after election time is opportunity to measure affective polarization of winners and losers

+ Set up database and distributed services (MongoDB, Hadoop, Google Cloud,  etc.)

## How to measure Political Ideology of Twitter users?

### Bayesian Spatial Following models

## Next: Classify condition of Users 

Echo Chamber vs. Mixed Environment

---

### Echo Chambers

Goal: Classify users into different conditions.

+ Based on 3200 latest tweets collected from the users
 
+ Look at their interaction with content produced by users with similar and dissimilar political ideology.

&lt;br&gt;

**I propose the three following conditions:**

1. *Echo Chambers* 

2. *Mixed Networks* 

3. *Neutral Networks*

## Measure Affective Polarization

---

### Affective Polarization

+ Question: How to measure affective polarization?

+ Machine learning classifier of text produced or shared by the users.

+  Perspective API from Google which provides a machine learning model to score toxicity of a given text.

+ Toxicity of user content when it mentions an *ideological opponent* **MINUS** the toxicity when it mentions *ingroup actors*.

+ Generate a list of terms associated with political actors for any given country context.

### Limitations

+ Current methodology does not account for users that do not follow political accounts

+ Methodology only looks at content that users interacted with
 + unable to assess what people *actually* see on their timeline
 + really resembles an echo chamber?
 
+ Ethics Question (account for GDPR)

+ Finally, using social media data in the proposed way has its up- and downsides. 

+ **&lt;font color="green"&gt;Plus:&lt;/font&gt;** Behavior in the online environment without potentially priming them with survey measures. 

+ **&lt;font color="red"&gt;Minus:&lt;/font&gt;** Computational methods to estimate ideological leaning and affective polarization need to be validated first. 

---

### Possible Extension

+ Combine this study of social media data with a survey of Twitter users

+ Random sample of users that will be sent messages on Twitter to participate in an online survey. 

+ The survey would include questions on 
  + exposure to differing views, both online and offline,
  + perceptions of democratic performance and legitimacy
  + affective polarization towards ideological oppponents. 

+ Compare results of this survey with behavioural measures proposed in this study to test their validity and robustness.

&lt;br&gt;

Finally:

**In my research outline I mentioned a few other ideas and I am open to pursuing them as well.**
