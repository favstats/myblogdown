## M.A. thesis topic:

Twitter ban of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones &amp; Infowars in September 2018

&lt;!-- During the post-intervention period, toxicity had an average value of approx. 0.080. By contrast, in the absence of an intervention, we would have expected an average toxicity of 0.15. The 95% interval of this counterfactual prediction is [0.13, 0.17]. Subtracting this prediction from the observed toxicity yields an estimate of the causal effect the intervention had on the response variable. This effect is -0.069 with a 95% interval of [-0.090, -0.046]. --&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

### Research Outline

+ "Filter Bubbles" (Pariser 2011) vs. “Echo Chambers” (Sunstein 2001). 

+ On social media, users are given the ability to browse, follow or otherwise make decisions on the content that they want to consume in ‘high choice media environments’ (Lelkes et al. 2017).

+ Given the psychological tendency to reduce exposure to incongruent viewpoints (Tsang 2017; Frimer et al., 2017), users might self-select into online echo chambers while being aided by algorithms that prioritize what the user wants to see. 

+ In a study that measures the effects of exposure to congruent partisan content in the US and Israel, evidence suggests that exposure to supportive information increases affective polarization (Garett et al. 2014).

### Research Question

How do homogenous digital environments affect people's evaluation of ideological opponents that they have little or no contact with? 

### Hypothesis

&gt; Individuals in online echo chambers (who interact mostly with their own ideological side) are more affectively polarized than individuals who are exposed to different political views. 


---


### Methodology


1. Identify relevant political accounts for each (European) country.

2. Collect data on Twitter from individuals who follow said accounts. 

3. Estimate political ideology of Twitter users.

4. Identify individuals who mostly interact with similar others (i.e. individuals in echo chambers) and those who interact with a variety of ideological dispositions.

5. Use machine learning models to estimate 'toxic' language targeted at ideological opponents in order to assess affective polarization.

6. Compare affective polarization of users within and outside of echo chambers&lt;

---


### Political Accounts on Twitter




+ Identify (official) Twitter accounts of politicians, parties, think tanks as well as political commentators and newspapers from various European countries.

+ [`legislatoR`](https://github.com/saschagobel/legislatoR) tracks publically available data for 32,533 current and former elected politicians from nine countries' legislatures including social media handles. 

+ More accounts with additional research, especially on the local and regional levels

+ Additional accounts can be webscraped from various sources

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img src="images/legislatoR.png" width="150" height="170" style="display: block; margin: auto 0 auto auto;" /&gt;




---


### Collect Twitter data

+ Collect a list of Twitter IDs for all followers identified political actors via the Twitter REST API. 

+ From each of these users I will retrieve their last 3200 tweets (as per Twitter API limit) and number of likes, retweets and replies of the collected tweets. 

+ We can expect that a large proportion of collected Twitter users who follow our target population will be bots, inactive or residents of a different country 

+ Exclude inactive Twitter users or those that could be bots

### Estimate Political Ideology

---

### Echo Chambers

Identify individuals who mostly interact with similar others (i.e. individuals in echo chambers) and those who interact with a variety of ideological dispositions.

+ Based on 3200 latest tweets collected from the users
   + This can be done at a later time to estimate trends over time
 
+ Look at their interaction with content produced by users with similar and dissimilar political ideology.


I propose the three following groups: 

1. *Echo chamber condition* in which users mostly interact with individuals who are ideologically similar to them
2. *mixed networks* in which users interact with individuals across the spectrum
3. *neutral networks* where users mostly interact with non-political content.


---

### Affective Polarization

+ Apply machine learning classifier to identify toxic content produced or shared by the users which is targeted at the opposing ideological side.

+ Here, affective polarization can be measured as the toxicity of user content when it mentions an ideological opponent. 

+ For this, I would generate a list of terms and names associated with political actors for any given country context.

+  One avenue to explore is the Perspective API from Google which provides a machine learning model to score toxicity of a given text 

+ However, the Perspective API so far only allows to score comments in English, French, Spanish and German which would limit the countries that could be studied this way.

### Limitations

+ Current methodology does not account for users that do not follow political accounts

+ Hope to collect enough of a given country's political sphere to meaningfully cover most potentially political input 

+ Methodology only looks at content that users interacted with
 + unable to assess what people *actually* see on their timeline
 + really resembles an echo chamber?

+ Finally, using social media data has its up- and downsides. 

+ The upside of using social media data is that we would study people as they behave in the online environment without potentially priming them with our survey measures. 

+ However, self-report measures have their value as well as they are more controlled, especially compared to the computational methods to estimate ideological leaning and affective polarization proposed in this study which would need to be validated first. 

---

### Possible Extension

+ I propose to combine this study of social media data with a survey of Twitter users, in a research desgin similar to Vaccari et al. (2016). 


+ Draw a random sample of users that will be sent messages on Twitter to participate in an online survey. 

+ The survey would include questions on exposure to differing views, both online and offline, perceptions of democratic performance, as well as affective polarization towards ideological oppponents. 

+ I could then compare results of this survey with behavioural measures proposed in this study to test their validity and robustness. 

+ In my research outline I mentioned a few other ideas and I am open to pursuing them as well.
