+ Algorithms are responsible for content that users see in their feeds 

+ Eli Pariser suggests that they can create a “filter bubble” effect or “autopropaganda”

+ by controlling what users do and do not see it can – and is in fact, designed to – dramatically amplify confirmation bias

+ The pre-filtering of content leads to bubbles in which people never view or read about opposing viewpoints

+ Creates seperated spaces that make communication between opposing viewpoints harder: undermines democracy itself

### What are Filter bubbles? And what's wrong with them?


The EU Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism notes that: 

&gt; Increasing filtering mechanisms makes it more likely for people to only get news on subjects they are interested in, and with the perspective they identify with. It will also tend to create more insulated communities as isolated subsets within the overall public sphere. [...] Such developments undoubtedly have a potentially negative impact on democracy.

*Vīķe-Freiberga, Däubler-Gmelin, Hammersley, &amp; Pessoa Maduro, 2013, p. 27*

&lt;br&gt;

**Filter bubbles are considered a concern at the highest level.**

## Research so far

### Research so far

The empirical evidence of a "filter bubble" effect is less clear and decidedly less pessimistic. 


+ Echo chamber about echo chambers (Guess et al. 2018)

+ Findings from a study on Facebook suggest filter bubbles are generated less by algorithms than by individual user decisions (Bakshy, Iyengar and Adamic, 2015). 

+ Customisability increases political polarisation, choice mitigates the effect of system-driven customization (Dylko et al., 2018). 

+ Research analysing news recommendation suggests essential information is not omitted (Haim, Graefe and Brosius, 2018) 

+ Personalised recommendations show no reduction in diversity over human editors (Möller et al., 2018). 

+ Finally, research on Google search results also finds factors such as time of search were more explanatory than prior behaviour and preferences (Courtois, Slechten and Coenen, 2018).

### Filter Bubbles and Extremism

There is a paucity of research studying the effects of personalisation algorithms on extremist content.

.pull-left[

]

+ Research on YouTube found that the recommender system could propel users into an immersive bubble of right-wing extremism within a few clicks (O’Callaghan et al., 2015)

+ Twitter’s “Who to Follow” recommendation was found to suggest violent extremist Islamist groups if the user followed al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra (Berger, 2013)

+ Facebook’s “Recommended Friends” function had likely actively connected at least two Islamic State supporters in South East Asia (Waters and Postings, 2018)

The architecture of the platforms may facilitate closer interactions than would otherwise exist.

## Research Question and Design

### + an example

---

## Research Questions 

&gt; Do algorithms promote extremist material once a user begins to interact with such content?

&gt; Does changing online behavior successfully change the content that algorithm recommendations prioritize or do they inhibit change?

**Research Design:**

+ Experimental design with social bots on various platforms. 

+ Let them interact with different kinds of content as treatment.

+ Establish a baseline for each bot where each account does nothing for a while.

The following user types are suggested:

1. *Neutral Interaction Bots* interact with neutral content 
2. *Extreme Interaction Bots* interact with extreme content 
3. *Baseline Bots* do nothing to establish a baseline

Pull timelines of each bot multiple times a day.

---

### Expected Relationships

+ Frequency of extreme content increases after interacting with extreme content

+ Extreme content is prioritized by the algorithm when interacting with extreme content

+ Bots that receive treatments will react more slowly to behaviour change than baseline bots

**Methods**

1) Test for count data with the help of poisson models

2) Use ranked logit regression to estimate ranking of content


---


### Research Example

+ Research Grant by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT)

+ Investigating filter bubble effects specifically in the context of right-wing extremism

+ We collected timelines two times a day over a period of two weeks

+ Every bot subscribed to the same 20 YouTube channels

+ All bots do nothing for a week, then one account interacts with extreme, another with neutral content

+ Every piece of content gets a unique rank per session and an Extremism Media Index (EMI) Score (Holbrook, 2015)

---


### Research Example

Of the 1443 videos coded on YouTube, 949 (65.77%) are rated as moderate according to the EMI, while 409 (28.34%) were judged to be fringe and 85 (5.89%) were deemed to be extremist. 

The figures on the next two slide shows the distribution of the EMI scores for each session with a rank from one to eighteen, depending on where the video appears on the “Recommended Videos” section as well as the percentage distribution of the three categories of content before and after each treatment.

## Conclusions and Future Research

---

### Future Research

+ More accounts

+ Longer period

+ Control for likes, shares, views etc.

**Linking research to real-life implications:**

+ The psychological aspects of how long it takes people to be influenced by content, or what type of content is the most influential would be a opportunity to supplement the research in a case study

### Selective Exposure

This means that people tend to 

+ select content (selective exposure),
+ interpret it (selective perception) and 
+ later better remember the information (selective retention) 

that is in line with their already existing ideas (cf. Zillmann and Bryant 1985)

## Personalization algorithms

Social media platforms, and the algorithms that drive them, are now an inescapable part of contemporary life. In many ways, they are the hallmark of the “Web 2.0” era, differentiating dynamic smart platforms from the static websites and fora of its previous incarnation. These algorithms are responsible for the content that users see in their feeds; the content they are recommended; and the products that they are advertised. Despite this, little is known about their operational workings or their effects on users because they are central to platforms’ business model (DeVito, 2016). This is even more the case with regards to extremist content and their role in trajectories towards terrorism.

## Personalization algorithms

Personalisation algorithms started as their current incarnation around 2009 when Google started implementing personalised search results for all searches. The basic idea is that social media platforms filter information that they believe will be of interest to you. 

We don’t know exactly what any of these algorithms are or how they work – social media platforms keep it very secret as it’s central to their business model. As such conducting robust research on it is a big problem. However, factors such as your previous interactions, location, user interests, relationships, and age all play a part. 

In 2019, almost all of the algorithms for the larger social media platforms are driven by machine learning tools so rather a simple formula it’s an ever evolving piece of code that’s different for each user.

Many people have warned about the effects of such algorithms on users and groups. This was done most famously by Eli Pariser in his 2011 book “The Filter Bubble” in which he claimed that such algorithms control what we do and do not see, upsetting the delicate cognitive balance and dramatically amplifies confirmation bias.
