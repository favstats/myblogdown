In the media and public discourse there is a lot of discussion around filter bubbles &amp; echo chambers.

They supposedly destroy democracies and radicalize their users.

On the upper right you can see a YouTube analysis of recommended Videos based on the 2018 Chemnitz violent demonstrations in Germany.

## Relevance

.pull-left[

+ Selective exposure can be overridden by factors such as personal recommendation. 

+ Selective exposure often does not translate into real-world outcomes.

+ Much of the public is not attentive to politics and thus unlikely to be in an echo chamber of any sort.

## Relevance

![](images/algo_extremism.png)

&gt;"[...] these data suggest that YouTubes recommendation algorithm actively discourages viewers from visiting radicalizing or extremist content. Instead, the algorithm is shown to favor mainstream media and cable news content over independent YouTube channels with slant towards left-leaning or politically neutral channels."


---

## Relevance

![](images/algo_extremism.png)

The problem with this study (and many similar studies) is that they *only use the API* to get their data.

The data collection **does not** mimic the user-platform relationship at all and does not take into account personalization, which is one of the most important aspects of the filter bubble.

---

## Goals

Three main contributions of this thesis:

1. Theoretically and analytically distinguish echo chamber from filter bubble effects.

2. Focus on what algorithms do before analyzing how algorithms influence people and societies.

3. Development and application of an **algorithm audit study** that can be used on other platforms and contexts.

## Echo Chambers vs. Filter Bubbles

## Echo Chambers vs. Filter Bubbles


The main difference refers to the **authority in charge of selection**. 

--

&lt;!-- While in an echo chamber, users are mainly in charge of selecting the content they will be exposed to, in the case of filter bubbles, an individual does not directly control which content is selected and how the selection happens. In fact, as algorithms are the default on most prominent social media pages, users could be totally unaware of algorithmic selection. --&gt;

**Echo chamber mechanism**

A user chooses to read specific sources or follow users that reinforce the opinion that they already hold.


&amp;#x2192; Explicit Personalization (Thurman &amp; Schifferes 2012)

--

**Filter bubble mechanism**

A platform will track user behavior and curate their news feed accordingly.

&amp;#x2192; Implicit Personalization (Thurman &amp; Schifferes 2012)


???

Both echo chambers and filter bubbles signify a state in which a person is only exposed to their own political or social views. However, they differ in one main aspect: authority.

In an echo chamber it can be reasonably assumed they are in charge of selction. You subscribe to a newspaper. You follow a person.

In a filter bubble, the algorithm decides what kind of content you will ultimately see.
+ It's black box.
+ People may not be aware of algorithmic selection.
+ Think it shows the public sphere

## Hypotheses

---

## H1: Explicit personalization

Tailoring content by explicitly telling the algorithm what kind of content the user is interested in.


&gt; H1: Ideological crosscutting content will be displayed in the same proportion as the user explicitly tells it to.


---

## H2: Implicit vs. Explicit personalization

If a person engages with content on Twitter (by liking, retweeting and commenting) they reveal more information about their preferences.

&gt; H2: Implicit personalization deprioritizes ideologically crosscutting content more so than explicit personalization. This will be true in terms of frequency (H2a) and ranking (H2b).

---

## H3 &amp; H4: Algorithmic vs. non-algorithmic timelines

Personalized algorithms may be expected to show less crosscutting content than non-algorithmic timelines.

&gt; H3: Algorithmic timelines (explicitly and implicitly pesonalized) deprioritize crosscutting content more than non-algorithmic ones. This will be true in terms of frequency (H3a) and ranking (H3b).

&gt; H4: Implicitly personalized timelines deprioritize crosscutting content more than non-algorithmic timelines. This will be true in terms of frequency (H4a) and ranking (H4b).

---



## H5: "Radicalization" Hypothesis

Without built-in limitation, we would expect that the more an algorithm learns about the ideological leanings of their users the more partisan the content it displays will be.

&gt; H5: Implicitly pesonalized timelines are more ideologically partisan than explicitly personalized (H5a) and non-algorithmic timelines (H5b).

## Measurement of Ideology

The measure for political ideology needs to fulfill two purposes: 

1. provide info on who the bot should follow, and 

2. serve as the dependent variable for the hypotheses to be tested.

## Conclusions

## Conclusions

### H1: Explicit personalization


&gt; H1: Ideological crosscutting content will be displayed in the same proportion as the user explicitly tells it to.

Despite the tweet rate being higher and lower for the accounts of the opposing side that conservative and liberal bots followed, respectively, the personalization algorithm tried to come closer to the initial stimulus of 30% crosscutting content (Liberal Observer bots: 31.93%; Conservative Observer bots: 36.44%).

--

&amp;#x2192; H1 confirmed



---

## Conclusions


### H2: Implicit vs. Explicit personalization


&gt; H2: Implicit personalization deprioritizes ideologically crosscutting content more so than explicit personalization. This will be true in terms of frequency (H2a) and ranking (H2b).


### H4: Implicit personalization vs. Non-algorithmic Timeline

&gt; H4: Implicitly personalized timelines deprioritize crosscutting content more than non-algorithmic timelines. This will be true in terms of frequency (H4a) and ranking (H4b).

--

Providing more information to the algorithm (through engagement) has produced the most homogeneous and least diverse timeline as hypothesized in terms of frequency (confirming H2a and H4a) and deprioritized crosscutting content in terms of rank (confirming H2b and H4b).

&amp;#x2192; H2 and H4 confirmed


---

## Conclusions


### H3: Algorithmic vs. Non-Algorithmic Timeline


&gt; H3: Algorithmic timelines (explicitly and implicitly pesonalized) deprioritize crosscutting content more than non-algorithmic ones. This will be true in terms of frequency (H3a) and ranking (H3b).

--

Algorithmic timelines are only less diverse with deprioritized crosscutting content for bots of the conservative ideology type, but not for bots in the liberal ideology type. Thus hypotheses H3a and H3b can only be confirmed for conservative users.

&amp;#x2192; H3 only confirmed for conservative bots

---

## Conclusions

### H5: "Radicalization" Hypothesis

&gt; H5: Implicitly pesonalized timelines are more ideologically partisan than explicitly personalized (H5a) and non-algorithmic timelines (H5b).

--

Bots in the Engage condition consistently received more partisan content in comparison to explicitly personalized and chronological timelines.


&amp;#x2192; H5 confirmed


---

## Conclusions

The thesis succesfully discerned echo chamber from filter bubble mechanisms.

It showed how implicit personalization:

1. decreases the relative frequency of ideologically crosscutting content

2. deprioritized the rank of crosscutting content

3. increased the ideological intensity (partisanship) of the content in the user timeline



---

## Conclusions

The study presented in this thesis ran from 29th October 2019 to 30th November 2019. 

This time range falls squarely within the impeachment hearings of U.S. President Donald J. Trump.

Considering the highly conflicted and partisan nature of this endeavor, it is not unreasonable to ask what algorithms and in specific Twitterâs algorithm do to the quality of discourse when each partisan side is stuck in a filter bubble and is predominantly confronted with opinions and commentary from their own political side

## Appendix

## Research Design

**Chronological Timeline**

This condition will serve as a counterfactual for each bot as it simulates what a given user would have seen if no algorithmic filters are applied.


Instead, chronological timelines for each bot are constructed in the following way: first, all tweets created by the accounts that bots follow in their respective time they were active are collected via the Twitter API. This serves as the pool of tweets that each bot could have potentially seen. Each time a bot started a session, it also made a note of the exact time and date that it started. So for instance, if a bot session was initiated on 11 am on November 13th, 2019 and collected 124 tweets, the equivalent chronological timeline was constructed by considering the entire pool of tweets that the bot could have seen and filtering it only to include the 124 latest tweets after 11 am November 13th, 2019. This way, we can ensure that all chronological timelines are the exact same tweets that a user would have seen at that specific time if it were not for algorithmic sorting.

## Conclusions - Research Questions


+ *RQ1:* Can we distinguish echo chamber from filter bubble effects?

--

Yes. Implicit and explicit personalization produce different outcomes.

Despite the tweet rate being higher and lower for the accounts of the opposing side that conservative and liberal bots followed, respectively the personalization algorithm tried to come closer to the initial stimulus of 30% crosscutting content (Liberal Observer bots: 31.93%; Conservative Observer bots: 36.44%).

&amp;#x2192; H1 confirmed

---

## Conclusions - Research Questions

+ *RQ2:* Does the algorithm infer political ideology from user data, and does that
lead to an ideologically homogeneous timeline over time?

--

Yes.

Providing more information to the algorithm (through engagement) has produced the most homogeneous and least diverse timeline as hypothesized in terms of frequency (confirming H2a and H4a) and deprioritized crosscutting content in terms of
rank (confirming H2b and H4b).

When implicitly offering more information to the Twitter algorithm by engaging with a specific type of content, the percentage of crosscutting content is reduced substantially after a month: we can observe around **13-14% less crosscutting content** for both liberal and conservative bots.

---


## Conclusions - Research Questions

+ *RQ3:* Are algorithmic timelines ideologically more homogeneous than non-algorithmic ones?

+ *RQ4:* If the algorithm promotes homogeneity, does it affect conservative and liberal content to the same extent?

--

Mixed.

Algorithmic timelines (which entail both Observer and Engager timelines) are only less diverse with deprioritized crosscutting content for bots of the conservative ideology type, but not for bots in the liberal ideology type. Thus hypotheses H3a and H3b can only be confirmed for conservative users.

---

## Conclusions - Research Questions

+ *RQ5:* Does the algorithm âradicalizeâ users by showing them increasingly partisan
content?

--

Yes.

Bots in the Engage condition consistently received more partisan content over time and in comparison to just self-selection (Observers) and chronological timelines, thus confirming hypotheses H5a and H5b.
